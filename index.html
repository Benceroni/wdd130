      Howdy, my name's spencer. I'm a big fan of video games and it's part of
      why i love programming. Every program i make is like a video game. I get
      to think about how the user will interact. What is the person going to
      want to do with the program? What looks <strong> nice?</strong> What do
      they not need? It's so much fun to get to make something for other people
      and get creative with it. I think part of my love for it comes from
      distain for some other peoples work. I dislike it when programmers miss
      something that i want to do- especially when it's commonplace- like in a
      video game when i can't map 2 actions to the same input. I think that
      ability to give the users the tools they want and to present it nicely is
      a part of what makes a programmer good. I was wondering if you like video
      games? I hope you like my art.<br /><br />

      <strong>Here is a list of things i like to do:</strong>

        Making text adventures in python that have to be played at my desk in

        don't want to bother to get it all set up on their pc.
